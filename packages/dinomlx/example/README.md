# DINOMLX Example Project

This directory serves as the **Reference Implementation** for a DINOMLX project. It demonstrates the expected input structure, the intermediate representation (IR), and the final build output.

## Directory Structure

### `src/` (Source Code)

This is the input for the DINOMLX compiler.

*   **`pages/`**: Contains the HTML files that map directly to routes.
    *   `index.html`: Becomes `/index.html`.
    *   `above-the-fold.html`: Defines which components are critical for the initial render.
*   **`templates/`**: Reusable HTML components.
    *   `navbar.html`: A navigation bar component.
    *   `atoms/`: Atomic components like buttons.
*   **`candidates/`**: (Concept) Location for CSS candidate definitions, though in this example they are inferred from usage.

### `ir/` (Intermediate Representation)

This directory contains the JSON files generated by the compiler during the build process. These files are useful for debugging and understanding how the compiler sees your project.

*   **`pages/*.json`**: The fully resolved structure of a page, including its component tree, data slots, and localization keys.
    *   See `ir/pages/index.json` for a detailed example of the page schema.
*   **`templates/*.candidates.json`**: Lists the CSS classes used by each template.
    *   See `ir/templates/navbar.candidates.json`.

### `dist/` (Build Output)

This is the final, deployable output of the build process.

*   **`index.html`**: The compiled HTML file. Note that **Critical CSS** for above-the-fold content is inlined in the `<head>`.
*   **`shared/deferable.css`**: Contains all non-critical CSS (below-the-fold, hover states, etc.), loaded asynchronously to improve performance.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1.  **Critical CSS Extraction**: Notice how `dist/index.html` has styles in the `<head>` but also links to `deferable.css`. This split is automatic based on the `above-the-fold` analysis.
2.  **Component Composition**: `index.html` uses `<c-navbar>` and `<c-atoms-primary-button>`, which are resolved from the `templates/` directory.
3.  **Localization**: The IR shows how text is extracted into `i18n` keys (e.g., `hash_title`).

## Running the Example

(Instructions to run the CLI against this example would go here once the CLI is fully implemented).
