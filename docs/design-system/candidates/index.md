# CSS Candidates

## The Problem
When composing applications from multiple providers, duplicated CSS declarations for the same conceptual styles are common. For example, two teams might implement a "primary button" with slightly different CSS, leading to code bloat and inconsistency.

## The Solution: CSS Candidates

A **Candidate** is a semantic contract between the HTML template and the CSS generation system. Instead of writing raw CSS or using utility classes directly in a disorganized way, templates declare the "candidates" they need.

The system treats these class names as requests for styling.

### Definition

Candidates are HTML class names reserved solely for styling. They are well-known, defined keys that map to specific CSS rules generated by the design system.

*   **Prefixing**: Candidates SHOULD be prefixed for easy identification by compilers (e.g., `_can_` or simply by convention like `button-primary`).
*   **Layering**: Candidates MUST be defined inside a specific `@layer` (see [Layers](../layers.md)) to control specificity.
*   **Centralized Generation**: The actual CSS for a candidate is generated by a central build process, ensuring deduplication and consistency.

### Example

Template:
```html
<button class="button-primary text-large">Click me</button>
```

The compiler identifies `button-primary` and `text-large` as candidates and generates the corresponding CSS in the build output.

See [Distributed CSS Management](../../architecture/distributed-css-management.md) for the full architectural protocol.
